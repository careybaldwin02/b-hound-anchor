                  The comprehensive B-hound system is a low-cost, software
                  driven mechanism that relies primarily on surveillance devices
                  already deployed and owned by potential customers. A user's
                  phone becomes a wireless sensor once the app is installed, and
                  video surveillance cameras deployed independently provide
                  feeds into the database. Additional high-powered dedicated
                  sensors and video cameras are deployed by the network's
                  operators as needed.

                    Manual contact tracing is time-intensive, costly and
                    inefficient. This approach relies on memory and holds the
                    potential to leave out contacts, surfaces, and air
                    contamination.

                    Proximity based monitoring (Google and Apple) using
                    anonymized serial numbers can notify people if they came
                    into close proximity to an infected person. This system does
                    not pick up all phones and uses encrypted data violating
                    privacy laws if shared.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We have a more comprehensive system, because we can track a
                    personâ€™s historical locations which allows identification of
                    contacts and potentially contaminated surfaces and air. Our
                    patented technology relies only on unencrypted beacons sent
                    from every phone (all types) on a regular basis. We can
                    determine the locations of phones and identity of users in
                    order to generate a comprehensive database of all historical
                    location trails. This is all accomplished without violating
                    any privacy laws. With this data we could create
                    geographical visualizations and interface with an expansive
                    database of video surveillance recordings to verify identity
                    and location.

                    An answer for the <b>defund the police</b> movement that
                    streamlines police services with technology capable of
                    performing the job more safely, efficiently and
                    transparently. A low-cost software-driven manpower
                    multiplier for police. Just as technology has lowered the
                    costs for other industries by replacing tasks performed
                    physically by human beings with more efficient machines, it
                    can automate surveillance of public venues as well as police
                    responses to reports of criminal activity for both uses
                    against criminal suspects and questionable police behavior,
                    allowing police to avoid interactions with criminal suspects
                    in conditions that could endanger police or civilians, while
                    simultaneously providing public transparency for incidents
                    of police misconduct and police reporting of crime
                    statistics. Additionally, serving as a bridge between police
                    and the anticipated influx of social workers that allows the
                    two interrelated services to better coordinate their
                    responses to reports of criminal activity.

                    publically available geolocation data transmitted by smart
                    devices on a regular bases. Our patented technology has
                    already been used on multiple occasions to identfy car
                    burglars responsible for multiple offenses. This was
                    accomplished through the detection of MAC addresses. Police
                    used the captured MAC addresses in coordination with
                    wireless service providers to identify the burglars.

                    provides an array of utilities to facilitate a broad
                    spectrum of national security initiatives. These fields of
                    endeavor include the prevention of terrorist attacks by
                    tracking terrorist operatives, emergency responses to
                    natural and man-made disasters in which authorities need to
                    rapidly locate individuals, immigration enforcement through
                    enhanced border monitoring of illegal immigrants, and
                    non-violent riot suppression by identifying rioters and
                    associating them to corresponding criminal activities.
