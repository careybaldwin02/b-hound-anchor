                  The comprehensive B-hound system is a low-cost, software
                  driven mechanism that relies primarily on surveillance devices
                  already deployed and owned by potential customers. A user's
                  phone becomes a wireless sensor once the app is installed, and
                  video surveillance cameras deployed independently provide
                  feeds into the database for location data and illustrative
                  interfaces. Additional high-powered dedicated sensors and
                  video cameras are deployed by the network's operators as
                  needed.

                    In a country that claims to be technologically advanced, one would expect a cutting edge, comprehensive solution to reduce the spread of Covid-19.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Digital tracking systems have been proposed as a means of monitoring the locations of individuals infected with the virus.  The current options are so poor that governments are not even discussing their application for suppressing the pandemic, and instead are focused on extremely expensive manual contact tracing programs that rely on memory and hold the potential to leave out contacts, surfaces, and air contamination.. The reasons for the failures of current digital contact tracing systems include the reliance on individuals downloading an app in order to track them, an exclusive reliance on users always enabling Bluetooth networking when traveling in public, which represents a cyber security and battery hazard, and a reliance on infected individuals self reporting themselves through the app. Additionally, these proximity-based approaches provide imprecise locational data that can lead to false positives and negatives in terms of contact incidents.  Despite much fanfare, the Google and Apple contact tracing API has fallen flat and appears to be a complete dud for these reasons. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The B-hound tracking system resolves these shortcomings, and does not rely on individuals to download the app for our system to track them, it does not rely on Bluetooth exclusively but rather all wireless networking options including Cellular and Wi-Fi in addition to Bluetooth along with extensive location tracking by video surveillance, and it does not rely on self reporting of infected patients. This low-cost alternative to manual contact tracing holds the potential for much more comprehensive location monitoring and quarantine adherence verification. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our system can track a personâ€™s historical locations which allows identification of contacts and potentially contaminated surfaces and air. Our patented technology relies only on unencrypted beacons sent from every phone (all types) on a regular basis. We can determine the locations of phones and identity of users in order to generate a comprehensive database of all historical location trails. This is all accomplished without violating any privacy laws. With this data we could create geographical visualizations and interface with an expansive database of video surveillance recordings to verify identity and location.
                  </p> 
                  <p> 
                    As a result of the aforementioned features of our technology, our system presents to the public for the first time the ONLY digital contact tracing technology that holds the potential to achieve location monitoring of the 75% minimum threshold of the population that experts contend is necessary for effective contact tracing across an entire population.

                    The B-hound system offers a low-cost software-driven manpower multiplier for police. Just as technology has lowered the costs for other industries by replacing tasks performed physically by human beings with more efficient machines, it can automate surveillance of public venues as well as police responses to reports of criminal activity for both uses against criminal suspects and questionable police behavior, allowing police to avoid interactions with criminal suspects in conditions that could endanger police or civilians, while simultaneously providing public transparency for incidents of police misconduct and police reporting of crime statistics. Additionally, serving as a bridge between police and the anticipated influx of social workers that allows the two interrelated services to better coordinate their responses to reports of criminal activity.  This is a solution to the dilemma of shrinking police budgets and the Black Lives Matter movement's conflict with the police.  The streamlining of police services with technology capable of performing the job more safely, efficiently and transparently would bring countless additional benefits for police departments and the communities they serve.

                    using publicly available geolocation data transmitted by smart 
                    devices on a regular basis. Our patented technology has already 
                    been used on multiple occasions to identify car burglars 
                    responsible for multiple offenses. This was accomplished through 
                    the detection of MAC addresses. Police used the captured MAC 
                    addresses in coordination with wireless service providers to 
                    identify the burglars.

                    tracking terrorist operatives, emergency responses to
                    natural and man-made disasters in which authorities need to
                    rapidly locate individuals, immigration enforcement through
                    enhanced border monitoring of illegal immigrants, and
                    non-violent riot suppression by identifying rioters and
                    associating them with corresponding criminal activities.

              <h3>Privacy and Legal Considerations</h3>
              <p>
                The B-hound tracking system operates from a secure legal foundation 
                which is critical to ensuring a viable business model.  There exists 
                no legal privacy protection for a person's location status when they 
                are in a public venue.  The B-hound technology never accesses encrypted 
                data and does not violate any privacy rights.  It also does not infringe 
                on existing patents because our team, unlike our competitors, acquired 
                a patent for our technology before launching it.  Having attended to these 
                considerations, our team is confident that the B-hound tracking system will 
                be robust to even the most intense legal scrutiny.
